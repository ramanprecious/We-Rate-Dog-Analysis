#  [We Rate Dogs Analytics](https://github.com/ramanprecious/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/WeRateDogs/wrangle_act.ipynb)

This project focuses on the use of data analytics skills, with major concentration on pandas, to analyse datasets obtained from twitter's space. The real purpose of the project is to wrangle and visualize a real-world data to expose hidden insights and answer questions. 

**WeRateDogs** is an internationally recognised account on the twitter platform, with over four million active followers, which engages its audience to rate posted dog images. The dataset explored in this project was derived from three seperate pieces of data gathered from WeRateDogs using three data gathering techniques. The gathering methods are **downloading locally**, **downloading programmatically** and **use of Twitter API**. The report of the several wrangling procedures is found [here](https://github.com/ramanprecious/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/WeRateDogs/wrangle_report.ipynb).


Some of the questions answered include:
> 1. How optimized is the image recognition algorithm model?
> 2. Which dog name(s) is the most popular?
> 3. Which dog name(s) is the least popular?
> 4. Which dog breed is the most popular?
> 5. Which dog breed has the highest and lowest average ratings?
> 6. Which dog stage has the highest average favorite and retweet count?
> 7. Which dog stage is largely dominant in the dataset?
> 8. Which dog breed has the highest average favorite and retweet count?
